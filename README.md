# openai_assistant_API
A basic flask app calling the Open AI Assistant API.

To get this runnning do the following:

1.  Make an OPenaI account and get API key - add to env
2.  Make an assisatnt in the openAI dashboard - its actually easier than using the API and reduces the chance of making errant calls to the API and getting charged for them.
3.  Get that Assistant ID and update your version of the flask
4.  Run it baby.
